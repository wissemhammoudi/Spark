Introduction
In today’s fast-paced world, the ability to process and analyze 
data in real time is more than a luxury 
— it’s a necessity for any business that aims to deliver timely 
insights and respond quickly to market changes. 
This is where real-time data engineering comes into play, 
forming the backbone of analytics platforms that can handle 
streaming data efficiently and effectively.

This project, “End-to-End Real-Time Data Engineering: A Project 
Template Guide with Kafka, Spark, PostgreSQL, and Dash,” 
is designed to provide a comprehensive walk-through of setting 
up a real-time data pipeline, from initial data production and 
messaging to processing, storage, and finally, interactive 
visualization.
Part 1: Data Production and Messaging, 
focuses on the foundational step of our pipeline: producing and sending data using Kafka. 
Here, we’ll explore how to set up a Kafka Python producer to generate and send data streams 
and how to configure Apache Kafka using Docker-Compose for robust, scalable messaging. 

Building a Kafka Python Producer Service:
In order to build our service, we need out producer logic in 
a python script, a Dockerfile to define the container of this python script and a requirements.txt file to install the required dependencies for our python script to run in a containerized environment. Place all these files inside a kafka_producer folder to separate the services from each other in folder level.
